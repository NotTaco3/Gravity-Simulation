A gravity simulation using OpenGL and C++ that models gravitational interactions between objects. It calculates forces based on Newton's law of gravitation, visualizes objects as spheres, and updates their positions and velocities in real-time. The simulation includes camera controls and object collision detection, I made this project in a month!
