A gravity simulation using OpenGL and C++ that models gravity with C++. It calculates forces based on Newton's Law of Gravity, visualizes objects as spheres, and updates their positions and velocities in real-time. The simulation includes camera controls and object collision detection. I completed this project in a month, all solo.

The physics are incredibly janky and outdated; they don't work very well, and eventually will slowly collect the force and drift away from their area.
