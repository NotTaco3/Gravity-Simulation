A gravity simulation using OpenGL and C++ that models gravity with C++. It calculates forces based on Newton's law of gravity, visualises objects as spheres, and updates their positions and velocities in real-time. The simulation includes camera controls and object collision detection; I made this project in a month, all solo!
